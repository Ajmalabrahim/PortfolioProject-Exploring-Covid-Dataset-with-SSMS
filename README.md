# PortfolioProject-Exploring-Covid-Dataset-with-SSMS

In this project I go through the most up-to-date Covid Dataset. I try to learn as much as I can from the datset by querying the data to show drill-down effects Covid has on each 
continent and more specifically, each country. I look at each country's covid death rate, as well as how much of the population is vaccinated, how much of the population
has covid, and I then store the queries into views which I then used to make a Dashboard in Tableau.
